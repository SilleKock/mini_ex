For my throbber I wanted to create something new and creative - and thereby challenge the more 'classic' throbber design we know from fx Youtube and other social medias. My throbber consists of a running water tap. Three drops of water appear in a circular structure to create the illusion of running water. The style is a bit childish both in the motive and the colors I have chosen. I think this could maybe lighten the user's mood in a situation where he encounters a throbber, but on the other hand I can also see the opposite happening where the frustration of waiting gets even worse. 

I have used the time related syntax frameRate and also used variables to control when the drops appear in the program. In this matter I have used if-functions and boolean expressions. This was the most difficult part for me working on this exercise. However, it was interesting to try out and it gave me a better understanding of how programming works in general - it really is a matter of thinking in a certain way. I really enjoyed drawing the water tap and also creating a function for the water drops. I like being able to execute my ideas through this medium. Also, working with different fill colors and transparency really gives exciting opportunities.

A throbber hides what exact processes that are happening - to compare, a processbar tells a lot more about how much has been processed, sometimes how much time is left and what is being processed at the moment. The throbber hides all of this from the user, who is left with no clue on how long the throbber will appear on the page. To an experienced user of the internet the sight of a throbber can be, to say the least, frustrating. Although, if focusing on making throbbers more interesting to look at, maybe they could be less annoying. But either way, a throbber will always be something that the user hasn't requested - but I like the concept of making the waiting time more desirable. I'm not sure, as mentioned above, whether my throbber can do this, but I believe that it has an untraditional form that might be a little interesting - at least for a couple of seconds.
