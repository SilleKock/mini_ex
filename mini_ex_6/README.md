For this mini exercise I was very inspired by the programs from the Generative Design website. I really liked the simplicity of these generative programs and I found it fascinating how a simple program can create so many different visuals as it evolves over time and/or through interaction. The vision for my program was to capture this simplicity and work with mouse interaction to generate new visuals. 

The rules in my program:
1. Draw rectangles in a grid
2. When the mouse moves up and down the y-axis the stroke color of
the rectangles change gradually
3. also, the rectangles rotate
3. When the mouse moves along the x-axis the stroke weight and the
size of the rectangles increases

I have used two for-loops to create the grid of rectangles. One of the assigned tasks was to make a program that utilizes a conditional statement, and I wanted to use an if-statement in terms of changing the stroke color gradually as the mouseY increases. However, I couldn't make it work, so I found another way around it, with the result that my program doesn't utilize a conditional statement, unfortunately. 

My program doesn't work autonomously - the user has to make some movement with the mouse to generate a visual. The outcome is completely unexpected when entering the blank page. The element of surprise is what encouraged me to make the color change, because this is something the user can't predict even when the rectangles starts to appear. 
The visual of the program cannot be predicted nor is it built on randomness. The user's movement with the mouse generates the program. Although the user can only do a limited amount of actions, the program can generate hundreds of different visuals. Considering the programs we have looked at in class, I think this is sort of a different take on generative programs as it requires human interaction.
