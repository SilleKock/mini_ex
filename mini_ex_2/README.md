For this exercise I wanted to focus on drawing recognizable figures instead of just simple shapes. Also, I wanted the program to be interactive. My program consists of a lightbulb that turns on if you click the button. When the light is off there are two sets of eyes looking at the lightbulb, and when the user presses the button and the light turns on then the eyes will look straight at the user. The intention is that the user will feel as if it has been caught doing something that it shouldn't have. The user is intended to turn the light back off immediately. 
Through this exercise I have learned how to make a button. Although, I was very frustrated in the process, I'm happy that I had the patience to learn it anyway. I also tried the if-function in terms of determining in what area the mouse should be clicked to turn the light on. 

I find the program fun in a subtle way. It is not 'ha ha'-funny but I think it surprises the user in some way and I think you could interpret that as fun. It addresses Goriunova's notion of fun in the sense that the program is completely useless but at the same time it makes the user wanting to press the button a couple of times before leaving the program. I think this captures the notion of fun - the program is not about functionality nor thoughtfulness. It is just for fun.
