This is my first experience with coding. It was fun trying out for the very first time, but I felt constrained because of my lack of knowledge of what was possible to do and how to do even the simplest things. My program reflects this in its simple form. I focused on learning the basics such as setting the background, the stroke and fill of the figures. I enjoyed how I could make the figures transparent. I made the shape 'ellipse' which I copied from the reference list on p5.js.'s website. I changed the width and height and also the x-coordinate and y-coordinate so that the figure would follow the cursor. This made it possible to interact with the program which I found interesting. 

Through this experience I realized how programming is in fact like learning a new language. You need to think in a certain way to understand, how what you type affects the program. For instance, it makes a difference whether you put the background function in 'setup' or 'draw'. Understanding this made is easier for me to visualize how coding works. I also learned that if you misspell a word or forgets to write a certain letter in capital the program might not work. Here programming differs from writing a text, because I don't think a simple mistake in spelling or gramma is that crucial - you properly still understand the text. However, the way of forming the meaning and content of the program is very similar to writing a text. Also, to read the code you need to know the 'language' of coding.  

I'm excited to learn more about this new language and way of thinking and hopefully get a greater impression of the potential of coding.
