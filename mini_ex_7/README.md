#### Each of you in the group analyze your own e-lit work by using the text 'Vocable Code': what is the aesthetic aspects of your program in particular to the relationship between code and language?

- Primary: understodd by the computer, secondarily to be understood by a human 
- Reversed roles 
- Computer Love by Kraftwerk 
- In line with the theme 
- The lyrics of the song is not whats important, but it supports the overall purpose of the program in some way 
- A comment on the relation between human and computer
- We have deconstructed the text by breaking it down to smaller pieces and then putting it together in a slight different way to give it a new
- We have used words from the text to define variables, functions and so on to incoorporate as much of the text as possible, and certainly to make the code readable for humans. 

Quote from the text 'Vocable Code': *“'secondary notation', a pejorative term suggesting that code's primary purpose is to be executed by a computer, and only secondarily to be understood by a human.”*

Computer reads it in the same way: the program show all of the words, the same calls for the code - but it is very different for a human, who proably will not be able to make much sense of the program but will actually understand the code easier
