Our idea was to make a program that to switch the relation between human, computer and code. The inspiration to do this, came from reading the text Vocable code:

*"'secondary notation', a pejorative term suggesting that code's primary purpose is to be executed by a computer, and only secondarily to be understood by a human."* (Cox, Geoff and Mclean, Alex, 2013, p. 23) 

The programs purpose is to reverse there roles. We wanted our program to be primarily readable to the computer and the code to be readable for humans. Instead of making our own literature we choose to find some already existing, and we choose the song 'Computer Love' by Kraftwerk. We found the theme of this song quite relevant in terms of our ideas for our program. We broke down the lyrics in to smaller bits and used differents words from the song to define variables, functions and make if-statements. Our aim was to include as much of the lyrics in our code as possible and to make it easier for humans to read. The code is not the exact lyrics - some lines are switched around, and by adding if-statements we have deconstructed the text and given it a slight different meaning. 

In terms of the code, we have split the code into two sketch files so that we could work with the aesthetics of our code. We wanted the 'primary' sketch file to be clean and easy to read, and the second one to contain all the 'data' such as variables and arrays. The program on the other hand, is much more of a computer language - a JSON file containing all the words from the songn categorized into nouns, verbs and so on. To a human this side doesn't make much sense. One could argue that the code and the program contains the same information - all words are the same - but the way they are interpreted and understood is way different. This challenges the relation between code and language.
