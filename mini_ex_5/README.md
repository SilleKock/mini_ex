My game consists of three cups and one ball that is hidden when entering the game. The ball is placed randomly beneath one of the cups and the user is to guess which cup hides the ball. The game is rather simple and the user's ability to 'win' the game doesn't depend on skills but entirely on luck. When the user has pressed a cup all the cups are lifted to reveal which cup hid the ball. A text that says 'press enter to try again' pops up and the game reloads. 

The cups are objects made from a class with not many attributes. The individual objects only differ from the other objects in their placement. I could have made an attribute called color so that the cups had different colors. I haven't used many methods - only 'show' that makes the objects visible. I tried using a method called 'move' to make the cups move, but I couldn't make it work, unfortunately. Instead I used if-statements to make the cups move when the mouse is pressed. 

The good thing about making object-oriented programming is that it makes it easy to make multiple objects fast and make them differ in some parameters such as color, size, placement, speed and so on. Also, the code is more organized and easier to manage because you can work with the class-based objects without making changes in the actual class. When programming games this an advantage because games often contain similar objects with similar attributes and functions. Although, this is not really the case in my game which might be a shame in terms of the exercise. But either way, I got to try out the class-function. 

Working on this exercise I realized how complicated it is to make games. I would have liked to add more features to my game and make it more exciting to play, for example by applying a counter that registers how many times the user has guessed correctly. However, this was way out of my reach. It got me thinking about other games I have played and how complicated those actually are. I know now that it is way more complicated than I thought to apply simple-looking features such as monitoring when the user has won or lost the game.
