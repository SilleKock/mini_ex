For this mini exercise I found it very difficult to come up with a concept for my program. Due to the lack of ideas I had to deal with some time pressure, which made the process sort of frustrating. I wanted to challenge myself by using the p5.dom library, so this was my goal for this exercise. Technically I met a lot of obstacles, and the program I ended up with is not what I initially had in mind. I had to change it because my technical-level didn't correspond with my ambition - unfortunately. Therefore, the program is very simple visually. I have used text-syntaxes which I, for some reason, haven't tried before. I also tried experimenting with the random-function. But I wasn't able to make it work the way I wanted it. Furthermore, I have made a button from the p5.dom library. This was more of a challenge than I had expected but finally I made it work. Although, I think I could have done it in a simpler way. 

My program captures how data capture and big data collects data about us that can be used to predict our action patterns. The program focuses partially on marketing aspects - it tries to get people to buy/do specific things by telling the user that he/she need to buy/do specific things.  This is something that I have come across with on the internet many times in terms of categories as 'you may also like' or advertisement on social media based on your data, recent searches etc.
Creating this program got me thinking about how much data about us are being captured. The internet knows so much about us that it might even be able to predict our emotional state and knows what we need when feeling sad, happy, angry and so on. The computer can suddenly become a friend that gives us advice on how to get better if we feel bad.
